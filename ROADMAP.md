<h1>Training Assistant Roadmap</h1>

<p>So right now, TA is pretty simplistic and is standalone with no network connections being made, no persistence, etc. As time goes on, this will hopefully be expanded on roughly as follows:</p>

<h3>Short Term</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Add configuration options, most likely stored in an XML file</li>
	<li>Ability to output HTML reports - the function is there, just need to code the output</li>
	<li>Add local persistence for keeping track of your sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Longer Term</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Since ARTCCs have vastly different websites and data architecture, an upload API would have to be implemented by individual webmasters.</li>
	<li>Perhaps look into somehow automagically registering events using a VATSIM data feed ala sweatbox server.</li>
</ul>
